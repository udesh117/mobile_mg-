# Assignee Quick Guide

## 🎯 What is an Assignee?

**Assignee** = The person responsible for completing a task

- Stored as `assigneeId` in the task
- It's a **Firebase Auth User ID** (automatically generated)
- Optional - tasks can be unassigned

---

## 🔄 How It Works (Simple Flow)

```
1. User Signs Up
   ↓
   Firebase Auth creates account
   ↓
   Generates unique userId (e.g., "a1b2c3d4e5f6...")
   ↓
2. User Creates Project
   ↓
   Project owner automatically added as member
   ↓
   Their userId stored in projectMembers collection
   ↓
3. User Creates Task
   ↓
   Selects assignee from dropdown (project members)
   ↓
   Selected member's userId becomes task.assigneeId
   ↓
   Task is now assigned!
```

## 💡 Key Points

### ✅ What You Need to Know:

1. **`userId` is generated by Firebase Auth**
   - Created automatically when user signs up
   - Unique for each user
   - Format: Long alphanumeric string

2. **Project owner is automatically a member**
   - When you create a project, you're added as a member
   - You can assign tasks to yourself

3. **Assignee = Project Member's userId**
   - When you select an assignee, you're selecting a project member
   - Their `userId` is stored as `assigneeId` in the task

4. **Currently only project owner can be assigned**
   - No UI to add other members (not required)
   - But the system supports it if you add members later

## 📱 Where You See Assignees

### 1. **In Task Creation Modal**
- Dropdown shows project members
- Select member → They become assignee
- Shows first 8 characters of userId

### 2. **In Task Card**
- Shows "Assigned" badge if task has assignee
- Avatar with first letter of userId

### 3. **In Analytics**
- "Tasks by Assignee" section
- Shows count of tasks per assignee
- Lists assigneeId (first 8 chars)

## 🔍 Example

```
User signs up with email: "john@example.com"
↓
Firebase Auth generates: userId = "abc123xyz456..."
↓
User creates project: "My Project"
↓
Project member created:
  - userId: "abc123xyz456..."
  - role: "owner"
↓
User creates task: "Fix bug"
↓
Selects self as assignee
↓
Task created:
  - title: "Fix bug"
  - assigneeId: "abc123xyz456..."  ← Same as userId
↓
Task shows "Assigned" in UI
```

## ❓ Common Questions

### Q: Where does the userId come from?
**A:** Firebase Authentication generates it automatically when user signs up. You don't create it manually.

### Q: Can I see the full userId?
**A:** Currently, only first 8 characters are shown in UI. Full userId is stored in database.

### Q: Can I assign tasks to other people?
**A:** Currently only to project owner (yourself). To assign to others, you'd need to add them as project members first (no UI for this yet, but hooks exist).

### Q: What if I don't assign a task?
**A:** That's fine! Tasks can be unassigned. Just leave assignee as "Unassigned".

### Q: How do I change assignee?
**A:** Tap on task → Edit modal → Change assignee dropdown → Save
